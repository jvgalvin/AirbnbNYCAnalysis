# Purpose
The purpose of this personal project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis.

# Context
This was conducted during the early stages of the Coronvirus-19 outbreak. I had moved back to California from New York and wondered how COVID-19 may have impacted the peer-to-peer housing market.

# Data
I used data published by Airbnb here - http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

# Top Line Summary
The total number of listings in NYC plummeted during the initial stages of COVID-19. The mean price per night was affected to a greater extent in Manhattan than in Brooklyn, despite an equivalent drop in total number of listings in both boroughs.
